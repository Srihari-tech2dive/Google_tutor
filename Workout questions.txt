        The Pyramid Builder 

        **Your task** is to write a program that takes an integer `n` as input and prints a right-angled triangle pattern of asterisks (`*`) with `n` rows.

        **Example:**

        * **Input:** `5`
        * **Expected Output:**
            ```
            *
            **
            ***
            ****
            *****
            ```

        The Prime Number Checker 

        **Your task** is to write a program that takes an integer `n` as input and determines if it's a **prime number**. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

        **Examples:**

        * **Input:** `7`
        * **Expected Output:** `7 is a prime number.`
        * **Input:** `10`
        * **Expected Output:** `10 is not a prime number.`

        **1. Sum of All Numbers**
        Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers, like `[1, 5, 2, 9, 4]`, and calculates the sum of all the numbers in the list using a `for` loop.

        **2. Countdown**
        Write a program that uses a `while` loop to print a countdown from 10 down to 1, and then prints "Liftoff\!".

        **3. Print Even Numbers**
        Write a program that prints all the even numbers from 1 to 20.

        **4. Find the Maximum Number**
        Given a list of numbers, `[45, 67, 23, 89, 12, 55]`, write a program to find the largest number in the list without using the built-in `max()` function.

        **5. FizzBuzz Challenge** 
        This is a classic programming challenge. Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

        **6. Count the Vowels**
        Write a program that takes a string (e.g., "Hello World") and counts the number of vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) in it. The check should be case-insensitive.

        -----

        **7. Prime Number Checker**
        Write a function that takes a number as input and prints whether it is a prime number or not. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

        -----

        **8. Print a Triangle Pattern**
        Write a program using nested `for` loops to print the following pattern:

        ```
        *
        **
        ***
        ****
        *****
        ```

        **9. Simple Password Guessing Game**
        Create a simple game where the program has a secret password. The user gets three attempts to guess the password. Use a `while` loop that runs as long as the user's guess is incorrect AND they have attempts remaining. Provide feedback if the guess is wrong and break the loop if they guess correctly.
